==================
**tr_data.json** - main file for translators, simple JSON file with single dictionary where *key* is string with Japanese text and *value* is string with English (currently) translation. This is very simple for read, edit and add new entries.

**en.json** - main file for [KCT](https://github.com/KanColleTool/KanColleTool) it's similar as previous file but contains crc32 hash instead of Japanese strings for memory and traffic economy. Can be generated by jp2crc.py (see below).

**jp2crc.py** - simple python script for generating crc32 hashes from Japanese strings for [KCT](https://github.com/KanColleTool/KanColleTool). Usage is very simple `jp2crc.py -i input_file -o output_file` where imput - file like **tr_data.json** and output - file for [KCT](https://github.com/KanColleTool/KanColleTool) like **en.json**.
